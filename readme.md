# Java 21

No Spring fans! Let's not live that drama. Java 21 is available as of the release of this video, and with it come a cornucopia of capabilities that, quite simply, are too good to ignore.   

In this installment we're going to look at some of the amazing features that have sort of come together in their final form in Java 21. These are not all new necessarily in Java 21, but they're certainly new relative to the (in my mind, at least) Java 17 release LTR release that preceded it.
